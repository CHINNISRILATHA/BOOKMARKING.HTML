      <p>In chemistry and physics, Raman scattering or the Raman effect is the inelastic scattering of photons by matter, meaning that there is both an exchange of energy and a change in the light's direction. Typically this effect involves vibrational energy being gained by a molecule as incident photons from a visible laser are shifted to lower energy. This is called normal Stokes-Raman scattering.Light has a certain probability of being scattered by a material. When photons are scattered, most of them are elastically scattered (Rayleigh scattering), such that the scattered photons have the same energy (frequency, wavelength, and therefore color) as the incident photons, but different direction. Rayleigh scattering usually has an intensity in the range 0.1% to 0.01% relative to that of a radiation source. An even smaller fraction of the scattered photons (about 1 in a million) can be scattered inelastically, with the scattered photons having an energy different (usually lower) from those of the incident photonsâ€”these are Raman scattered photons.Because of conservation of energy, the material either gains or loses energy in the process.The effect is exploited by chemists and physicists to gain information about materials for a variety of purposes by performing various forms of Raman spectroscopy. Many other variants of Raman spectroscopy allow rotational energy to be examined, if gas samples are used, and electronic energy levels may be examined if an X-ray source is used, in addition to other possibilities. More complex techniques involving pulsed lasers, multiple laser beams and so on are known.The Raman effect is named after Indian scientist C. V. Raman, who discovered it in 1928 with assistance from his student K. S. Krishnan. Raman was awarded the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of Raman scattering.</p>

      <p>Raman was born in Tiruchirappalli in the Madras Presidency of British India (now Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India) to Tamil Iyer Brahmin parents,Chandrasekhar Ramanathan Iyer and Parvathi Ammal.He was the second of eight siblings.His father was a teacher at a local high school, and earned a modest income. He recalled: "I was born with a copper spoon in my mouth. At my birth my father was earning the magnificent salary of ten rupees per month!" In 1892, his family moved to Visakhapatnam (then Vizagapatam or Vizag) in Andhra Pradesh as his father was appointed to the faculty of physics at Mrs A.V. Narasimha Rao College.
        Raman was educated at the St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School, Visakhapatnam.He passed matriculation at age 11 and the First Examination in Arts examination (equivalent to today's intermediate examination, pre-university course) with a scholarship at age 13,securing first position in both under the Andhra Pradesh school board (now Andhra Pradesh Board of Secondary Education) examination.In 1902, Raman joined Presidency College in Madras (now Chennai) where his father had been transferred to teach mathematics and physics. In 1904, he obtained a B.A. degree from the University of Madras, where he stood first and won the gold medals in physics and English.At age 18, while still a graduate student, he published his first scientific paper on "Unsymmetrical diffraction bands due to a rectangular aperture" in the British journal Philosophical Magazine in 1906.He earned an M.A. degree from the same university with highest distinction in 1907.[16][17] His second paper published in the same journal that year was on surface tension of liquids.[18] It was alongside Lord Rayleigh's paper on the sensitivity of ear to sound,and from which Lord Rayleigh started to communicate with Raman, courteously addressing him as Professor.Aware of Raman's capacity, his physics teacher Rhishard Llewellyn Jones insisted he continue research in England. Jones arranged for Raman's physical inspection with Colonel (Sir Gerald) Giffard.[20]</p>

      <p>Raman's elder brother Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar had joined the prestigious Indian government service, Indian Finance Service (now Indian Audit and Accounts Service).[23] Raman followed suit and qualified for the Indian Finance Service achieving first position in the entrance examination in February 1907.[24] He was posted in Calcutta (now Kolkata) as Assistant Accountant General in June 1907.[10]
        He was highly impressed by the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Calcutta, the first research institute founded in India in 1876.[22] He immediately befriended Asutosh Dey (who would eventually become his lifelong collaborator), Amrita Lal Sircar (the founder Mahendralal Sircar's son and secretary of IACS), and Ashutosh Mukherjee (executive member of the IACS and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta). With their support, he obtained permission to conduct research at IACS in his own time even "at very unusual hours," as Raman later reminisced.[13] Up to that time the institute had not yet recruited regular researchers,[25] or produced any research paper.[10] Raman's article "Newton's rings in polarised light" published in Nature in 1907 became the first from the institute.[26] The work inspired IACS to publish a journal, Bulletin of Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, in 1909 in which Raman was the major contributor.[13]</p>
